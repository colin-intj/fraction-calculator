# Fraction Calculator

My favorite part of the Python programming language is
[the fractions module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html). This
module enables programmers to represent irrational numbers as fractions, thus,
increasing accuracy. Since Java doesn't have an equivalent library, I wrote a
Java class that performs a similar function; to demonstrate it, I made this
simple fraction calculator. The calculator can add, subtract, multiply, and
divide expressions containing two operands; the best part is that it also
simplifies the solutions!

## How to Use

Once you run the file FractionCalculator.jar you should be greeted by the
following message:

```

```

The syntax of the calculator commands is:

`[operation] [fraction] & [fraction]`

The list of appropiate operations are:

- add
- subtract
- multiply
- divide

Fractions can be entered as either a decimal, whole number, or fraction in the
form: "[numerator] / [denominator]"

To exit the program, type "exit".

## Sample Run

```

> add 1/2 & 1/2
1/1
> exit

PROGRAM TERMINATED
```
