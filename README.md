# Fraction Calculator

## About

My favorite part of the Python programming language is the fraction module.
This module allows programmers to perform accurate mathematical operations
which would otherwise be impossible with floating decimals. And because I love
the fraction module so much, I was thoroughy dissapointed by the fact that
there isn't an equivalent library for Java, that's why I've taken it upon
myself to create my own!

## Program Design

To demonstrate my fraction class, I've created this fraction calculator. The
calculator works in a command shell-like fashion. It allows users to add,
subtract, multiply, and divide fractions until they choose to end the program.
The program also simplifies the output.

## How to Use

Once you run the file FractionCalculator.jar you should be greeted by the
following message:

```

The syntax of the calculator commands is:

`[operation] [fraction] & [fraction]`

The list of appropiate operations are:

- add
- subtract
- multiply
- divide

Fractions can be entered as either a decimal, whole number, or fraction in the
form: "[numerator] / [denominator]"

To exit the program, type "exit".

## Sample Run

```

> add 1/2 & 1/2
1/1
> exit
